# Blockchain-Demo

Thiis repo is A web-based demonstration of blockchain concepts.


# Ethereum-examples

In this repo you can find some code examples showing how easy integrating the Oraclize Ethereum API is.

Thanks to our Ethereum API helpers using Oraclize in your Solidity/Serpent code is very easy.

In Solidity it is as simple as inheriting the usingOraclize contract: this will provide you some functions, like oraclize_query, which make it trivial to leverage our technology straight away.


# Hydrachain


HydraChain is an extension of the Ethereum platform which adds support for creating Permissioned Distributed Ledgers. Its primary domain of application are private chain or consortium chain setups.


# Quorum


Quorum is an Ethereum-based distributed ledger protocol with transaction/contract privacy and a new consensus mechanism.

Key enhancements:

QuorumChain - a new consensus model based on majority voting
Constellation - a peer-to-peer encrypted message exchange
Peer Security - node/peer permissioning using smart contracts
Raft-based Consensus - a consensus model for faster blocktimes, transaction finality, and on-demand block creation


# Quorum-examples

This repository contains setup examples for Quorum.

Current examples include:

7nodes: Starts up a fully-functioning Quorum environment consisting of 7 independent nodes with a mix of block makers, voters, and unprivileged nodes. From this example one can test consensus, privacy, and all the expected functionality of an Ethereum platform.
permissions: Focuses on how to add, remove, and update the list of nodes permitted to participate in the network.
The easiest way to get started with running the examples is to use the vagrant environment.

# Steem_protocol

This repository defines the blocks, transactions, operations, and static validation that is independent of chain state. It can be used to build and sign transactions.
