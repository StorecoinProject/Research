This is supposed to be a step-by-step guide for dummies on Ethereum mining via Betarigs. A detailed knowledge of the concept expressed throughout will surely help, but it is not necessary to follow the guide. If you are interested in deepening your knowledge, please follow the link below:

At the final step of renting hashrate on Betarigs, you are usually asked to provide a mining   xxx. (Is this mandatory or just an option?)
With ethereum, that can't be the case. Pool mining won't be available for a while.
Quoting Stephan Tual:
https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/2233/ethereum-mining-pool
Short block times and GHOST utilization mean that the optimal pool size is so small it's not worth setting one up, as superlinear gains cannot be achieved.

It's unlikely that we'll see pools for a while, if at all.

Note: Ethereum algorithm. https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash (is it supported by betarigs?)
